Dimensing Technology is a high-tech company based at Pasadena, CA, focusing on developing multiscale all-in-one retinal imaging devices that address critical gaps in ophthalmic diagnostics. Our innovative technology integrates fundus cameras, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and angiography to deliver high-resolution, wide-field imaging for early detection and monitoring of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and inherited retinal diseases (IRD).

By leveraging wavefront shaping, optical system design, and cutting-edge image processing algorithms, our proprietary imaging technology enhances diagnostic capabilities, reduces device costs, and provides quantitative imaging solutions that go beyond retinal screening to broader applications in cardiovascular and neurodegenerative disease monitoring. Our mission is to bridge the technological gap in eye care by offering affordable, high-precision imaging devices that improve both clinical research and patient outcomes.
